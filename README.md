# Outliers 

	Outliers are extreme vakues that fall a long way outside of other observations.
	Outliers are those values which are very very different from most of the values.
	Example: There is a column callled Age for B.tech College 
		gene
	
# Bad for building predictive models

	Because these outliers can induce the state of confusiuon in the predictive models, 
  which in turn makes the model very weak for making dicision rules. 
	Then there are high chances that the model will not perform good.

# Reasons for having Outliers

	Data Entry Errors 
	Measurement Errors 
	Experimental Errors
	Sampling Errors 
	Natural Occurrences 

# Outliers Sources 

	In the process of producing, collecting, processing and analyzing data, 
  outliers can come from many sources and hide in any dimension. 
	
	Conclusion 
	Removal or treatment of outliers from the data for building a predictive model is 
  very important as many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the range and 
  distribution of attribute values in the input data. 

## Outliers in input data can skew mislead the training process of machine leaning algorithms.
